# group-8-project

## Description
- We created this group project to test and grow our collective knowledge and implemenation of JavaScript, API's, Local Storage, and CDN libraries and GitHub merges and conflicts with multiple users. 
- This project reinforced knowledge We have recently learned about how JavaScript in conjunction with API's can be used  to perform specific functions and store information in Local Storage for retrieval in various aspects of the code. 
- We did encounter some issues with merges and conflicts in GitHub and worked to correct them and make sure the code was still functional.
